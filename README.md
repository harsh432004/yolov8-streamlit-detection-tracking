# <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Real-time Object Detection and Tracking with YOLOv8 & Streamlit </span>

This repository is an extensive open-source project showcasing the seamless integration of **object detection and tracking** using **YOLOv8** (object detection algorithm), along with **Streamlit** (a popular Python web application framework for creating interactive web apps). The project offers a user-friendly and customizable interface designed to detect and track objects in real-time video streams from sources such as RTSP, UDP, and YouTube URLs, as well as static videos and images.



## Requirements

Python 3.6+
YOLOv8
Streamlit

```bash
pip install ultralytics streamlit pytube
```

## Installation

- Clone the repository: git clone <https://github.com/harsh432004/yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking.git>
- Change to the repository directory: `cd yolov8-streamlit-detection-tracking`


## Usage

- Run the app with the following command: `streamlit run app.py`
- The app should open in a new browser window.
